# This is a program that allows a human to play Tic Tac Toe with a smart AI. 
# The AI is implemented using minimax approach. The AI is a perfect one, meaning 
# that it will never lose and if there is an immediate win, it will play that. 
#
# It takes quite a long time to initialise and free up the memory for the AI. 
# All observed bugs have been fixed.
#
# In this program, we are very often need the memory from the heap. 
# But because a pair is the only data type allocated on the heap, 
# we have to use it. We very often need a data structure to store 
# a set of 3 objects. We will use the format below. 
# 
#  root --\
#         |
#        \|/
#          
#  +----------+----------+
#  |          |          |
#  |  front   | object 3 |
#  |          |          |
#  +----------+----------+ 
#       |
#       |
#      \|/
#          
#  +----------+----------+
#  |          |          |
#  | object 1 | object 2 |
#  |          |          |
#  +----------+----------+ 
# 
# We call this structure Pair4Three.
